# Fall-2016-Turtlebot

This fall we created an ROS Python program to allow Turtlebot to deliver items (thru basket) to any cubicle/office on the Engineering Building second floor. The orders are queued over a website, which users can request from.

sshnode.py is the ROS python program sqlsecond.py is the website from which people can order from.
